# The Xe Lam Cohort

Simple software. Small-scale. Fast in thought, not in speed.

**The Xe Lam Cohort** is a group focused on building minimal, maintainable software, not just in user interface, but in architecture. We value clarity over complexity, intention over trend, and persistence over performance theater.

Inspired by the xe lam: a modest, communal vehicle once common in Ho Chi Minh City.

Faded from the streets, not from memory.

## Cohort

We’re not a company. We’re a cohort. A band of people who build what they need, and nothing more.
